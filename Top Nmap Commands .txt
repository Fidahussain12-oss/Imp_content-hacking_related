üõ†Ô∏è Top Nmap Commands You Should Know:
Command	Purpose
nmap <target>	Basic scan: checks which ports are open. (Fast and simple.)
nmap -sV <target>	Service version detection: find out what services and versions are running.
nmap -O <target>	OS detection: guess the operating system. (Needs root/admin sometimes.)
nmap -sS <target>	Stealth/SYN scan: faster and stealthier than a full TCP connect. (Needs root.)
nmap -sU <target>	UDP scan: checks for open UDP ports (e.g., DNS, SNMP, etc.). (Slower.)
nmap -A <target>	Aggressive scan: combines -sV, -O, traceroute, and NSE scripts. Very detailed.
nmap -p <port(s)> <target>	Specify ports: scan specific ports (like -p 80,443,22).
nmap -Pn <target>	No ping: skip host discovery (good if ICMP is blocked).
nmap --top-ports 100 <target>	Scan the top 100 most common ports (faster recon).
nmap -T4 <target>	Faster scan timing (T4 = aggressive speed, still fairly reliable).
nmap -sC <target>	Run default scripts: useful for finding common vulnerabilities.
nmap -v <target>	Verbose mode: see more detailed output during the scan.
nmap -oA <basename> <target>	Output to all formats (XML, grepable, and Nmap) for later analysis.
nmap -6 <target>	Scan IPv6 addresses.
